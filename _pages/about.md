I'm Georg, an AI Engineer at [Synagen AI](https://synagen.ai){:target="\_blank"} and PhD student in the [Computer Vision Research Group](https://cvrg.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Ognjen ArandjeloviÄ‡](http://oa7.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"}.
Prior to this, I studied an integrated master's (MSci) in Computer Science at the same institution.
My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and computational pathology.
In particular, I am interested in weakly supervised biomarker prediction in histopathology images, as well as self-supervised learning and vision-language models.
